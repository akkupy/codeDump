## Contributing to Hacktoberfest üñäÔ∏è

Hacktoberfest is an annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source projects. This year, it runs from October 1st to October 31st.

If you're new to open source or just looking for a way to get involved, Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity to do so. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Find an open source project that you're interested in and see if they have any issues labeled "Hacktoberfest." If so, start working on those!

- If you can't find any Hacktoberfest issues, try looking for other issues that you can help with.

- Create your own.
